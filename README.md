# CapstoneProject_Java

Hey group, here is our repo for our Java Capstone Project!

I have a few links here that will be helpful when working with Github:

https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository

https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

Please review how PULL requests work, as they will be super important to our workflow!

When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push. Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.
